# make-my-life-easier
A couple scripts I use on a daily basis to make my life easier.
They are all ready to go command line tools :)

## Usage examples
### Decrypt only
The command line below will try to decode the encrypted price passed in command line.
```
go run google-private-data-encryption-test.go --encryptionkey=[YOUR_EKEY] --integritykey=[YOUR_IKEY] --price=ABbPkwAAAVYxMGEzNzQwMjY3_dtx7nbprWzvXg== --mode=decrypt
```
